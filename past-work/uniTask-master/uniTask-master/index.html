        This is a random dot task. Your screen will show a group of dots that are moving in many directions.<br /><br />
        On each trial, 30% of the dots will be moving in a coherent direction (left or right) and the other 70% will move randomly.<br /><br />
        You need to determine if the dots are moving left or right.<br /><br />
        If the dots are moving left, press the 'A' key. If the dots are moving right, press the 'L' key.<br /><br />
        You will have 60 seconds to acheive a score of 20.<br /><br />
        For each correct response, you will gain a point. For each incorrect response, you will lose a point. Points can go into the negatives.<br /><br />
        Once you achieve your goal, or the time runs out, the experiment will end and a copy will be saved locally in a .csv file.<br /><br />
        Press any key to continue.
